### How to install
It's very easy, for debian (my case), just in terminal: <br/>
`apt install conky` <br/>
and after this it's worth to consider: <br/>
`apt install conky-all`

To run *conky* just: <br/>
`conky`

Then should appear: <br/>

To get rid of the flicker run: <br/>
`conky -b`

### Important directories/files:
1. */etc/conky* - Conky main folder
2. */etc/conky/conky.conf* - Conky configuration file

Of course you can move *conky.conf* to *~/.config* direction, but I don't care
about this.
