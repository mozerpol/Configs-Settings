## Configs-Settings
I'm a user of linux based systems, so it's natural to use the cli apps sometimes. Because of this I have a problem to remember every shortcut. So I created this repo to save my own configs and (if it's necessary) list the most important for me shortcuts.

2. *NeoVim* - *Vim* fork
3. Translator in cli using *Translate Shell*
4. *grip* - markdown reader with web browser
